    <h2 class="left-m">Description:</h2>
    <p class="righter">This ice cream sandwich cake was renamed as "The Best Dessert I've Ever Eaten" by my daughter this Memorial Day. I had made it before, but my husband ate all of it before she had a chance to get a taste! My husband doesn't like when I take this desert to a large gathering because it means he won't have any leftovers!<br></p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="left-m">Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="righter">
        <li>24 vanilla ice cream sandwiches, unwrapped</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) containers whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge ice cream topping, warmed</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) jar caramel ice cream topping</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped pecans, or to taste</li>
        
    </ul>
    <br>
