1. In this project I will first only use HTML,
then in later lessons I will add some css to it,
and maybe later add javascript.
So lets just do this and I'll add notes to this file while going through it.
2. Ok so I just built the website with 3 recipes and a simple main page that has links to those 3 pages (index.html).
This will be it for now, I will add css to it in the next session.
3. Added some css to the pages, this was my first css project so not so bad I guess lol
