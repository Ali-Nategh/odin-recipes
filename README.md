1. In this project we will first only use HTML apparently,
then in later lessons we will add some css to it,
and maybe later even  add javascript.
So lets just do this for now and I'll add notes to this file while going through it.
2. Ok so I just built the website with 3 recipes and a simple main page that has links to those 3 pages (index.html).
This will be it for now, I will add css to it in the next session.
